## What I've done so far
- Follow the instructions on serverless stack and develop a React app more fully.
- Understand how to add auth to a React app and build Login/Signup modules based on previous knowledge.
- Figure out the complex logics behind handling login/signup request, add redirect on login and logout to improve user experience.
- Fix issue: users can't go back to confirm their unauthenticated account if they accidently refresh their page at the confirm step.
- Add core functionalities like creating a note, listing notes, and displaying a note to the app.
- Integrate third party API - Stripe to the React app to enable billing functionality.
- Secure our React pages by adding redirect routes if necessary.
- Learn how to deploy a React app to AWS using S3. CloudFront, enable HTTPS protocol to secure our app.
- Buy a customized domain name from Route 53, though not required by checkpoint 3, to make our React app more accessible to the public.

Since customized domain name already purchased from Route 53, I'll provide two app links with customized domain name to make our app more accessible to the public
